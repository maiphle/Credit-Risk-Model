# Credit-Risk-Model
Data mining project using RapidMiner

The project uses a decision tree model to predict the credit rating of customers (Bad or Good) based on various attributes to help bank managers decide about loan applicants. The data was analyzed using historical information on customers who have taken out loans from a bank, including whether or not they repaid the loans or defaulted.
